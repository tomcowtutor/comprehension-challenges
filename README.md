# Comprehension Challenges

This folder contains 5 small Python challenges (one per file) designed for
beginners learning list and dict comprehensions.

- `challenges/challenge_01_squares_of_evens.py` — list comprehension, beginner
- `challenges/challenge_02_upper_long_words.py` — list comprehension, easy
- `challenges/challenge_03_passing_scores.py` — dict comprehension, intermediate
- `challenges/challenge_04_vowel_counts.py` — dict comprehension, intermediate
- `challenges/challenge_05_flatten_squares_above.py` — nested list comprehension, challenging

Instructions:
- Open a challenge file and replace the body of the function (currently
  implemented with loops) with a comprehension that returns the same result.
- Run the file directly to see the example `print(...)` showing expected output.

Example run (bash):
```
python "challenges/challenge_01_squares_of_evens.py"
```

If you'd like, I can also add unit tests that check each function's output.
